# Clipmoji

Have you ever been in a situation where you really needed that one 👉👌❓ emoji combination, 
but you were using your PC and didn't have them readily available? Or maybe you just wanted 
to frighten your friends with that 🕷 on a 🥨, but neither WhatsApp Web, nor Facebook had them.

Well then, say no more! `Clipmoji` is here to solve all your problems! All you have to do is 
press `Ctrl + Alt`, start typing your favorite emoji's name between `:`, press the initial shortcut 
again, and 💥: your emoji is right there, for you to happily send. You're welcome.

## TODO

- [x] MAKE THE DAMN THING LISTEN FOR JUST `CTRL + ALT`, NOT `CTRL + ALT + L` BECAUSE IT FUCKING DELETES MY CODE WHEN I TRY TO REFORMAT IT
- [ ] Refactor the code to be more easily understood (<i>IN PROGRESS</i>)
- [ ] Remove the `emoji` dependency
- [ ] Add all emojis from https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
- [ ] Decide for a faster way to input emojis
- [ ] Add support for user-defined emojis (new ones or combinations)
- [ ] Add an overlay to help you choose from your options based on what you typed
